# Forgotten-Worlds-MD-Plus
Contains the source code for the patch used to make Forgotten worlds compatible with MD+.
This patch also includes a small fix to make the game compatible with 6-button controllers.
It won't allow you to make use of a 6-button controller's additional buttons but at least the game is playable without the need of holding the mode-button on start-up.
